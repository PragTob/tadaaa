# Tadaaa application
This is just a series of scaffolds and was built during my rides to the brilliant [eurucamp](http://2012.eurucamp.org/). It was just an experiment to see what one can do in little time and to get familiar with devise and cancan (never used them before, so I downloaded the docs and read them on the train). devise and cancan are awesome by the way. It didn't take long.

This is **not good code and should never be really deployed**. Also it **might not work**. This is just a **bare prototype**. I would **never write an app in this way for a real application**. It's something you can build within a short time, so you can tell your customer to come back in a couple of hours and show him/her a basic version of the app.

## What does the app do?
You can create users, users can login etc. Users can create offers (which might be anything). And you have a very rudimentary search based on the title of offers.

## What was used to build this?

- [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) - well the framework and all the scaffolds
- [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) - authentication & views for registration, sig in etc.
- [cancan](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan) - authorization
- [bootstrap-rails](https://github.com/anjlab/bootstrap-rails) - A gem porting [Twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) to scss and making it available as a gem
- [carrierwave](https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave) - used for picture uploads

## Recruiters
This isn't code I would actually write in an app. It's a **throwaway prototype**. There are no meaningful tests or something... it was fun anyway.
